Here are the material from R workshops given to the Human Genetics students of McGill. These workshops are organized by the [Human Genetics' Student Society](https://hgssmcgill.wordpress.com/).

The latest **Introduction to R** workshop was given in [september 2016](https://hgssmcgill.wordpress.com/workshops-seminars/r-workshops-2016-17/). Find material in the `Rintro` folder.

A more **advanced workshop** on data.frame manipulation, *ggplot2*, and *GenomicRanges* was given in 2015. See `HGSS_2015_2` folder.
